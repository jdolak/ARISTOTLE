## Proposal
We will create a telnet bulletin board system using the C language. This will allow users to log into a remote machine over telnet and receive a dashboard displaying information. This will include a chat room and news feed.

This is inspired by Bulletin Board Systems like CBBS and PLATO from the 1970s. Users will be able to interact with this system over telnet. This will be run on modern computer hardware but attention will be made to resemble the resource constraints of the era.
